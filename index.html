            <h3 class="section-subheading"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014806/">The Poker House (2008)</a></h3>
            <p class="section-content">The Poker House is set in a poor, small town in Iowa, circa 1976. An ordinary day in young Agnes' (Jennifer Lawrence) life is anything but. With a strung-out mother (Selma Blair), a pimp (Bokeem Woodbine) and a home overrun by gamblers, thieves and johns, Agnes is simply trying to survive with her two young sisters (Sophia Bairley and Chloe Grace Moretz). Inspired by true events this poignant, gritty film portrays lives that rise above dismal circumstances, and marks a powerful beginning for first time writer & director Lori Petty.</p>
